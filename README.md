# Image- Pull
 
This is a image scraping project that takes in a user's input and searches unsplash.com for images.

The program chooses 3 images randomly from the total collected and places them in a bin folder in the root directory where the python file is.

Finally it opens the folder so that you can view the images.

The script requires the following modules:

- bs4
- requests
- wxPython
- lxml

Usage - 

1. Download the zip archive and extract on your computer.
2. If your familar with pipenv, you can run pipenv sync in the directory with the Pipfile.lock file. This will install the needed modules into your virtual environment.
3. If you don't want to use the pipenv sync method, you can install the modules globally with pip install "name of module"
4. Once the modules are installed, run main.py. (not the gui.py file)
5. Enter a search term and hit the "search" button
