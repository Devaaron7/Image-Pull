# Image- Pull
 
This is a image scraping project that takes in a user's input and searches unsplash.com for images.

The program chooses 3 images randomly for the total collected and places them in a bin folder in the root directory where the python file is.

Finally it opens the folder so that you can view the images.

Uses the following Python Modules:

bs4 as bs
urllib.request
shutil
os
requests
random
webbrowser
wx

I've included a self contained executable version archived as a zip folder the includes all the modules. Just download the zip file, unzip and run the executable.
